# ERC20 Token Web Page

This web page connects to multiple ERC20 contracts across different blockchains, both L2 and L1, including Sepolia, Binance Smart Chain testnet, Polygon Mumbai, Fantom, and Avalanche. With this web page, you can mint and burn a set of ERC20 tokens, view data from all contracts across these chains, and interact with any contract you like. You can also connect to any wallet of your choice, such as Metamask or Coinbase, and if you don't have a wallet, the website still provides you access to blockchain data.
